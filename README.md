Hi I'm Subha! I am an incoming freshman at Stanford, majoring in Computer Science. I am also the founder and CEO of OpenNLP, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that helps startups & labs bring their visions to life by helping prototype, evaluate, & develop LLMs. You can learn more about our nonprofit organization on our website https://opennlplabs.org/, or on our GitHub profile @opennlplabs. I am actively working on a few projects there.

I've written a few papers spanning natural language processing, data science, and CS. The latest code/data for my papers can be found in my pinned repositories.

I'm always open to collaboration opportunities, so feel free to email me at subha2@stanford.edu with any details.

Thanks for stopping by!
