Hi I'm Subha! I am an incoming freshman at Stanford, majoring in Computer Science. I am also the founder and CEO of Linguistics Justice League, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that uplifts speakers of marginalized languages through innovative technology. You can learn more about our nonprofit organization on our website https://linguisticsjusticeleague.org/, or on our GitHub profile @linguisticsjusticeleague. I am actively working on a few projects there.

I've written a few papers spanning natural language processing, data science, and CS. The latest code/data for my papers can be found in my pinned repositories.

Thanks for stopping by!
